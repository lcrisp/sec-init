# secure-init System Architecture
## Technical Overview & Maintenance Guide

(Modified: sudo-hardening and finish logic combined into a single final module.)

## 0. Purpose
This repository implements a modular, reproducible bootstrap for Debian/Ubuntu systems using:
- YubiKey FIDO2
- PAM U2F authentication
- systemd-cryptenroll FIDO2 unlocking
- SSH resident FIDO2 keys
- GRUB password hardening
- udev, sudo, crypttab, initramfs, ufw tightening

The document explains how the system works so it can be safely maintained even if all chat history is lost.

## 1. Execution Model
`secure-init.sh`:
1. Logs all actions.
2. Discovers modules under `modules/`.
3. Executes them in ascending numeric order.
4. Executes the combined final module (`90_final.sh`) last.
5. Exports shared variables.
6. Stops immediately on any error.

## 2. Directory Structure
```
secure-init/
â”œâ”€â”€ secure-init.sh
â”œâ”€â”€ modules/
â”‚     â”œâ”€â”€ 00_preflight.sh
â”‚     â”œâ”€â”€ 10_packages.sh
â”‚     â”œâ”€â”€ 20_udev.sh
â”‚     â”œâ”€â”€ 30_enrol.sh
â”‚     â”œâ”€â”€ 40_pam.sh
â”‚     â”œâ”€â”€ 50_crypttab.sh
â”‚     â”œâ”€â”€ 60_initramfs.sh
â”‚     â”œâ”€â”€ 70_grub.sh
â”‚     â””â”€â”€ 90_final.sh   â† sudo-hardening + reboot handling
â””â”€â”€ packages.list
```

Numbered modules run in order; `90_final.sh` is always the last step.

## 3. Why Modules Are `sourced`
Modules are sourced so they share:
- Logging
- Error handling
- Environment variables
- State between modules

If executed in a subshell, information like enrolled key paths would not propagate.

## 4. Privilege Model
`secure-init.sh` **runs unprivileged**.

Modules use:
```
sudo <cmd>
```
only when needed. This ensures:
- YubiKey enrollment does not create root-owned files.
- SSH resident keys remain under `$HOME`.
- PAM and udev resources install atomically and safely.

Running the whole script under sudo would break enrollment and risk account lockout.

## 5. Module Responsibilities

### 00_preflight.sh
Validates:
- sudo availability
- required binaries
- correct user (non-root)
Creates environment and log file.

### 10_packages.sh
Installs:
- ufw
- libpam-u2f
- systemd-cryptsetup
- openssh
- keepassxc
- dracut (optional)

Idempotent.

### 20_udev.sh
Configures:
- YubiKey access rules
- plugdev group
- hidraw permissions

Ensures correct device ownership before enrollment.

### 30_enrol.sh
Handles:
- pamu2fcfg for both YubiKeys
- ssh-keygen -K for resident keys
- authorized_keys population
- systemd-cryptenroll for both keys

Must run as the normal user.

### 40_pam.sh
Enforces:
```
auth sufficient pam_u2f.so authfile=/etc/Yubico/u2f_keys cue
auth required   pam_deny.so
```
Inserted at the very top of:
- /etc/pam.d/common-auth
- /etc/pam.d/other

`pam_deny.so` must immediately follow pam_u2f.so.

### 50_crypttab.sh
Writes:
```
cryptroot UUID=<uuid> none luks,fido2-device=auto
```

Must precede initramfs rebuild.

### 60_initramfs.sh
Handles:
- dracut or initramfs-tools hooks
- fido2 + hid + usbhid inclusion
- rebuilds initramfs safely

### 70_grub.sh
- interactive password hashing
- writes 40_custom
- disables recovery entries
- updates GRUB safely

### 90_final.sh  (combined sudo hardening + reboot sequence)
Does two things:

#### 1. Installs sudo hardening:
```
Defaults timestamp_timeout=0
auth sufficient pam_u2f.so authfile=/etc/Yubico/u2f_keys cue
auth required   pam_deny.so
```
Installed via atomic sudoers.d file with visudo validation.

#### 2. Handles the final reboot
- Provides 10-second countdown
- User may cancel by pressing Enter
- Avoids sudo (timestamp likely expired)

This module **must always run last**.

## 6. Logging
All logs go to:
```
~/secure-init/secure-init.log
```
Never contains sensitive outputs.

## 7. Adding New Modules
Drop a file into `modules/`:
```
modules/25_firewall.sh
```
Rules:
- must be idempotent
- must not modify PAM, crypttab, GRUB unless explicitly intended
- must use `say` for logging
- must not require being run as root

## 8. Debugging
1. View logs:
```
cat ~/secure-init/secure-init.log
```
2. Re-run the entire script (safeâ€”modules are idempotent).
3. Run a single module:
```
source modules/40_pam.sh
```

## 9. Full Rebuild Workflow
1. Install Debian/Ubuntu.
2. Clone repo.
3. Run:
```
./secure-init.sh
```
4. Reboot.
5. System now uses:
   - FIDO2 LUKS unlock
   - PAM U2F-only login
   - SSH resident FIDO2 keys

## 10. Why This Document Exists
Written intentionally as a transfer-of-knowledge document for:
- future you
- future ChatGPT instances
- anyone maintaining the repo in the absence of session history

It ensures no part of the design is lost to time.

<<\DOC_END

This sample hook safeguards topic branches that have been
published from being rewound.

The workflow assumed here is:

 * Once a topic branch forks from "master", "master" is never
   merged into it again (either directly or indirectly).

 * Once a topic branch is fully cooked and merged into "master",
   it is deleted.  If you need to build on top of it to correct
   earlier mistakes, a new topic branch is created by forking at
   the tip of the "master".  This is not strictly necessary, but
   it makes it easier to keep your history simple.

 * Whenever you need to test or publish your changes to topic
   branches, merge them into "next" branch.

The script, being an example, hardcodes the publish branch name
to be "next", but it is trivial to make it configurable via
$GIT_DIR/config mechanism.

With this workflow, you would want to know:

(1) ... if a topic branch has ever been merged to "next".  Young
    topic branches can have stupid mistakes you would rather
    clean up before publishing, and things that have not been
    merged into other branches can be easily rebased without
    affecting other people.  But once it is published, you would
    not want to rewind it.

(2) ... if a topic branch has been fully merged to "master".
    Then you can delete it.  More importantly, you should not
    build on top of it -- other people may already want to
    change things related to the topic as patches against your
    "master", so if you need further changes, it is better to
    fork the topic (perhaps with the same name) afresh from the
    tip of "master".

Let's look at this example:

		   o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "next"
		  /       /           /           /
		 /   a---a---b A     /           /
		/   /               /           /
	       /   /   c---c---c---c B         /
	      /   /   /             \         /
	     /   /   /   b---b C     \       /
	    /   /   /   /             \     /
    ---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o---o "master"


A, B and C are topic branches.

 * A has one fix since it was merged up to "next".

 * B has finished.  It has been fully merged up to "master" and "next",
   and is ready to be deleted.

 * C has not merged to "next" at all.

We would want to allow C to be rebased, refuse A, and encourage
B to be deleted.

To compute (1):

	git rev-list ^master ^topic next
	git rev-list ^master        next

	if these match, topic has not merged in next at all.

To compute (2):

	git rev-list master..topic

	if this is empty, it is fully merged to "master".

## File: ./.git/hooks/push-to-checkout.sample
```
#!/bin/sh

# An example hook script to update a checked-out tree on a git push.
#
# This hook is invoked by git-receive-pack(1) when it reacts to git
# push and updates reference(s) in its repository, and when the push
# tries to update the branch that is currently checked out and the
# receive.denyCurrentBranch configuration variable is set to
# updateInstead.
#
# By default, such a push is refused if the working tree and the index
# of the remote repository has any difference from the currently
# checked out commit; when both the working tree and the index match
# the current commit, they are updated to match the newly pushed tip
# of the branch. This hook is to be used to override the default
# behaviour; however the code below reimplements the default behaviour
# as a starting point for convenient modification.
#
# The hook receives the commit with which the tip of the current
# branch is going to be updated:
commit=$1

# It can exit with a non-zero status to refuse the push (when it does
# so, it must not modify the index or the working tree).
die () {
	echo >&2 "$*"
	exit 1
}

# Or it can make any necessary changes to the working tree and to the
# index to bring them to the desired state when the tip of the current
# branch is updated to the new commit, and exit with a zero status.
#
# For example, the hook can simply run git read-tree -u -m HEAD "$1"
# in order to emulate git fetch that is run in the reverse direction
# with git push, as the two-tree form of git read-tree -u -m is
# essentially the same as git switch or git checkout that switches
# branches while keeping the local changes in the working tree that do
# not interfere with the difference between the branches.

# The below is a more-or-less exact translation to shell of the C code
# for the default behaviour for git's push-to-checkout hook defined in
# the push_to_deploy() function in builtin/receive-pack.c.
#
# Note that the hook will be executed from the repository directory,
# not from the working tree, so if you want to perform operations on
# the working tree, you will have to adapt your code accordingly, e.g.
# by adding "cd .." or using relative paths.

then
	die "Up-to-date check failed"
